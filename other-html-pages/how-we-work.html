<p class="when">
	When we have a deal with you, we will do the following:
</p>
<p>We keep your property under our care safe, manage it for you, make profits with it and give you 70% of the profit while we take 30% charge. None of your property under our care will be tampered with by anybody.</p>
<p>For those who keep their valuables like Gold, Diamond, houses, industies/companies, etc under our care, we give you 10% discount for the first two years. This is to say that we will only charge you 20% of the profits made from your valuables/properties for two years, after which we will start charging you the normal 30%. </p>

<p>
	For any dispute that emanates from your valuables/properties under our care, we will take reponsibility for any cost of recovery/settlement that will be involved.

	Once our deal with any of our customers ends, we shall cease taking responsibility for their valuable initially under our care. Also we won't be held responsible should there be any depreciation in profits they make from their property/valuable.
